# ðŸŽµ AutoHarmony

AutoHarmony is a music generation project powered by Recurrent Neural Networks, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. Trained on a dataset of MIDI-based music, the model learns to generate new musical sequences that mimic the structure and style of the input data.

## ðŸŽ¹ Sample Output

You can listen to a sample of the generated music from **sample.wav** .

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- **Model Type**: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- **Architecture**: LSTM
- **Input**: Musical note sequences
- **Output**: New music generated note-by-note

The model captures musical patterns over time and creates original compositions by predicting the next note in a sequence.
